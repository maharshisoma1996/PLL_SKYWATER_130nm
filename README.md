## Abstract
A phase-locked loop or phase lock loop is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input signal. Control system components include Phase frequency Detector, Charge Pump, Voltage Controlled Oscillator, Frequency Divider.

## Google-skywater 130nm
The SkyWater Open Source PDK is a collaboration between Google and SkyWater Technology Foundry to provide a fully open source Process Design Kit and related resources, which can be used to create manufacturable designs at SkyWaterâ€™s facility.

## Tools Used
    
   Prelayout, design and simulations: Ngspice
